## 1.0.2 (2012-04-09)

 - Added `clean`, `compile_cython` and `update_vendor` commands to `setup.py`.
   See `setup.py --help-commands` for more information.
 - Removed the `--cython` install option.
 - Sundown is now added as a Git submodule.
 - Exceptions that are raised in render methods are now shown on STDOUT. The
   script execution will not stop. Only the render method will stop and return
   nothing.
 - Removed trailing forward slashes from MANIFEST.in. These cause trouble on Windows.
   ([#12][]/[#13][])
 - Input text now be a byte or unicode string. Callback method arguments are
   always unicode. The returned text in a callback method can be a byte or unicode string.
 - In Python 3 render callbacks couldn't be seen, because the variable that was
   used to lookup the methods was a byte string. And Python 3 doesn't see
   byte string and normal strings as equal.
 - Added unit tests.
 - Updated Sundown files; See commits from Feb 05, 2012 to Mar 29, 2012.
   This includes fixes for Visual Studio on Windows:

## 1.0.1 (2012-02-07)

 - `PyInt_FromLong` was renamed to `PyLong_FromLong` in Python 3. A macro
   has been added to fix this. ([#7][])
 - Included the C file generated by Cython again and made Cython an optional
   dependency. The `.pyx` file can be compiled with the `--cython` option.
